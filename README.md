# Proxy

You need to run a proxy server to be able to fetch the rss content from it's source. You can use the [AllOrigins](https://github.com/gnuns/allorigins) one (it's open-source).

You can update the proxy's url in `$lib/constants.js` file under the `PROXY_URL` property.

# Running

Just run `pnpm run dev` to serve the website.
